  description: |
    AGM is a program for computing the arithmetic-geometric mean of complex numbers. It also computes a new function called khe (խ(z)) such that the AGM of խ(z) and խ(z+πi) is 1 for all z in the left half-plane, and one step of the AGM of these numbers produces խ(2z) as the arithmetic mean and խ(2z+πi) as the geometric mean.
