    Seq66 MIDI sequencer/live-looper with a hardware-sampler grid interface; pattern banks, triggers, and playlists for song management; scale and chord aware piano-roll; song layout for creative composition; and control/status via MIDI automation for live performance. Mute-groups enable/disable multiple patterns at once. Supports the Non/New Session Manager; can also run headless. Works in a space as small as 725x500 pixels (less if window decoration removed). It does not support audio samples, just MIDI.
